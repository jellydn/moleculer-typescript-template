    [Moleculer](https://moleculer.services/) with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) template
-   üì¶ [hygen](http://www.hygen.io/) - The scalable code generator that saves you time.
-   ü¶æ [pino](https://getpino.io) - super fast, all natural json logger
-   üî• [swagger-jsdoc](https://github.com/Surnet/swagger-jsdoc/blob/v6/docs/README.md) - Generates swagger/openapi specification based on jsDoc comments and YAML files.

## Install

```sh
pnpm install
```

## Usage

```sh
# Copy env file
cp .env.example .env
pnpm dev
```

After starting, open the http://localhost:3000/ URL in your browser.
On the welcome page you can test the generated services via API Gateway and check the nodes & services.

In the terminal, try the following commands:

-   `nodes` - List all connected nodes.
-   `actions` - List all registered service actions.
-   `call greeter.hello` - Call the `greeter.hello` action.
-   `call greeter.welcome --username dunghd` - Call the `greeter.welcome` action with the `username` parameter.

This project uses [hygen](http://www.hygen.io/) to generate code templates, saving you time and ensuring consistency across your codebase.

### Adding a New Service

To add a new service to your project, use the following command:

```sh
pnpm generate:service [service-name]
```

### Adding a New Action to a Service

To add a new action to an existing service, use the following command:

```sh
pnpm generate:action [action-name] --service [service-name]
```

### Generating CRUD Services

To generate a service with Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations, use the following command:

```sh
pnpm generate:crud [service-name]
```

## API Documentation

This template also reads your [JSDoc-annotated](https://github.com/Surnet/swagger-jsdoc/blob/v6/docs/README.md) source code and generates an OpenAPI (Swagger) specification.

Run the following command to generate the Swagger documentation:

```sh
pnpm generate:swagger
```

Open the http://localhost:3000/docs URL in your browser, you will see the Swagger UI as

## Run tests

```sh
pnpm test
```

## Deployment

This template comes with two GitHub Actions that handle automatically deploying your app to production and staging environments.

Prior to your first deployment, you'll need to do a few things:

-   [Install Fly](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/)

-   Sign up and log in to Fly

    ```sh
    fly auth signup
    ```

-   Create two apps on Fly, one for staging and one for production:

    ```sh
    fly create moleculer-typescript
    fly create moleculer-typescript-staging
    ```

-   Create a new [GitHub Repository](https://repo.new)

-   Add a `FLY_API_TOKEN` to your GitHub repo. To do this, go to your user settings on Fly and create a new [token](https://web.fly.io/user/personal_access_tokens/new), then add it to [your repo secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) with the name `FLY_API_TOKEN`.

Now that every is set up you can commit and push your changes to your repo. Every commit to your `main` branch will trigger a deployment to your production environment, and every commit to your `dev` branch will trigger a deployment to your staging environment.

## GitHub Actions

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. Anything that gets into the `main` branch will be deployed to production after running tests/build/etc. Anything in the `dev` branch will be deployed to staging.

## Useful links

-   Moleculer website: https://moleculer.services/
-   Moleculer Documentation: https://moleculer.services/docs/0.14/

## NPM scripts

-   `pnpm dev`: Start development mode (load all services locally with hot-reload & watch)
-   `pnpm start`: Start production mode (set `SERVICES` env variable to load certain services)
-   `pnpm cli`: Start a CLI and connect to production. Don't forget to set production namespace with `--ns` argument in script
-   `pnpm ci`: Run continuous test mode with watching
-   `pnpm test`: Run tests & generate coverage report
-   `pnpm dc:up`: Start the stack with Docker Compose
-   `pnpm dc:down`: Stop the stack with Docker Compose

## Pre-commit hooks

This template uses [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run checks before you commit your code. This ensures that your code is formatted correctly and passes all tests before you push it to your repository.

```sh
pre-commit install
```

To run the checks manually, use the following command:

```sh
pre-commit run --all-files
```
